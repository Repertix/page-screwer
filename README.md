# Page Screwer
A bunch of dumb commands ruin your actual internet experience. These are just a few codes that can be enabled through commands to make some dumb changes in the current website you're on. Made in 3 hours of boredom.

**Some pages may not be compatible with this dumb plugin as some of them are pretty protected.**

## Installing
1. Use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + I` in your preferred browser and website to open inspection mode.
2. Go to the **Console TAB**
3. Copy the code from `source.js` paste it in the command bar and press `Enter`
4. A list of commands will appear, so you can check out how to use them.
5. Enjoy
